# Predicting-House-Prices
## Machine Learning Project: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

### Goal
The objective of this project is to build a linear regression model that predicts house prices based on multiple features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and other key attributes. The model aims to provide insights into how these factors influence housing prices, supporting potential buyers and real estate agents in making informed decisions.

### Dataset
We use the Ames Housing dataset, which includes 79 explanatory variables that capture almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The features cover lot size, overall quality, year built, and several other attributes that contribute to house prices.

### Project Steps
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Analyze the dataset to identify missing or inconsistent data, and perform necessary cleaning to prepare it for modeling.
2. **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Select relevant features and engineer new ones if necessary to improve model accuracy.
3. **Data Splitting**: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.
4. **Build and Train the Linear Regression Model**: Develop the linear regression model using the training data and train it on selected features.
5. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, to ensure it accurately predicts house prices.

This project provides a systematic approach to understanding the real estate market in Ames, Iowa, and offers a practical tool for price prediction.
